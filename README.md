## About 

 JavaFx layout Pane that provides supports for drawers
 (pane containers) that slide in from the Top, Right, Bottom and Left.
 The drawers can optionally be detached from the DrawerPane and floated
 within their own window. Drawers can also be dragged between the
 sides of the pane.
 
 Sliding the drawers in/out is controlled with buttons on toolbars that
 surround the DrawerPane on the Top, Right, Bottom and Left. The toolbars
 can optionally be disabled/enabled independently. And, the toolbars
 and buttons can be styled using CSS.
